# Spectral Vegetation Indices
A spectral vegetation index (SVI) is generated by combining data from multiple 
spectral bands into a single value. Usually simple algebraic formulations, 
SVIs are designed to enhance the vegetation signal in remotely sensed data 
and provide an approximate measure of live, green vegetation amount.



# Installation

## Requirements

* espa-bulk-downloader - see corresponding README file




## Getting started with quick examples

### [1] Download Landsat products
After the order of Landsat products has been made available, run the following command inside the 'bulk-downloader' directory to bulk download the data:

```console
python ./download_espa_order.py -d /path/to/a/dir/you/want/to/download -u username -o order_id
```


### [2] Pre-processing step(s)
  
Create a raster stack NumPy from the raw, multispectral satellite data:
    
```console
python create_raster_stack.py --root_dir xxxx --region_name yyyy
```
    
Optionally - plot composite RGB Image (for visual inspection)

```console
python plot_RGB_img.py --full_filename /path/where/image/stack/is/stored/xxxx.tif --to_file filename_to_save_the_plot.png
```
    

### [3] Calculate spectral vegetation indices

#### NDVI

```python
from Landsat8.spectral_vegatation_indices.NDVI import calculate_NDVI, plot_NDVI, classify_NDVI
from utils import splitall

full_filename = '/path/where/raster/stacks/are/stored/Hiraan-2013-May-20.tif'
allparts, raster_stacked_filename = splitall(full_filename)
ndvi = calculate_NDVI(full_filename)
plot_NDVI(ndvi,raster_stacked_filename)
classify_NDVI(ndvi,raster_stacked_filename) #Categorise NDVI results into useful classes
```


#### VCI

```python
from Landsat8.spectral_vegatation_indices.VCI import calculate_VCI, plot_VCI, classify_VCI
from utils import splitall

full_filename = '/path/where/raster/stacks/are/stored/Hiraan-2013-May-20.tif'
allparts, selected_full_filename = splitall(full_filename)
vci = calculate_VCI(full_filename)
plot_VCI(vci,selected_full_filename)
classify_VCI(vci,selected_full_filename) 
```
