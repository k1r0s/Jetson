Calculating Vegetation Condition Index (VCI)

The Vegetation Condition Index (VCI) is used to monitor vegetation condition.

VCI definition:
Kogan proposed a Vegetation Condition Index (VCI) based on the relative Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI)
change with respect to minimum historical NDVI value. The VCI therefore compares the current Vegetation Index (VI)
such as NDVI or Enhanced Vegetation Index (EVI) to the values observed in the same period in previous years within a specific pixel.
